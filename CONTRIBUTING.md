# Contributing to Ancestor-Evenrs-Importer

Generally, we are expecting the core contributors to just be steele232 and coryswainston. 
If we find other people who would like to contribute, then that would be great too. 

## Android Native App
- coryswainston will be covering this

## iOS Native App
- coryswainston might cover this, but we might be looking for someone to cover this side of things. If you have this skill, talk to us :)

## Flutter App
- steele232 has an interest in this, but we don't have to do this. it depends how things turn out

## FamilySearch API
- steele232 will be covering this area of the app

## Onwards and Upwards
Who knows how far this project will go. Hopefully we will be releasing the app and it will benefit the lives of many. 
If we continue to have a demand for features and we have time to accommodate those requests, then we will. We may end up along for some help

Cheers!
Steele232
